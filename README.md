# Motor Imagery Classification for Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCI)

## Introduction
The primary objective of this research is to advance the field of motor imagery (MI) classification by accurately categorizing EEG data obtained from participants during cognitive tasks into specific MI task categories related to bodily movements. EEG signals recorded through scalp electrodes, provide sequential data from multiple participants engaged in these trials. The MI classification domain has witnessed significant progress, driven by innovative methodologies designed to enhance precision and efficiency. Researchers have explored diverse techniques to address the intricacies of MI classification, such as deep domain adaptation, Bayesian convolutional neural networks, and discriminative Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) feature learning. Hybrid models have also emerged, including transfer learning-based CNN and LSTM hybrids, as well as ETSNet for EEG-based temporal-spatial pattern recognition. Additional avenues of exploration encompass multiwavelet-based sparse time-varying autoregressive modeling, multivariate variational mode decomposition, and real-time single-trial EEG analysis. Recent studies have leveraged convolution, attention mechanisms, autoencoders, and channel selection to enhance MI classification accuracy. 

## Conclusion
In Motor imagery classification within Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), this research embarked on a comprehensive exploration. Our experiments encompassed applying different models, from traditional LSTM to advanced hybrid models such as CNN+GRU and Bi-LSTM-CNN. These endeavors highlighted the significance of model selection in EEG-based motor imagery classification. Notably, we achieved the highest test accuracy with LSTM and Bi-LSTM models, underscoring their effectiveness in this context.

These findings reinforce the importance of data preprocessing and feature extraction in enhancing classification accuracy within the motor imagery classification domain. Additionally, the challenges faced during this research, including data acquisition limitations, underscore the complexities inherent in EEG data collection and the need for robust solutions.
